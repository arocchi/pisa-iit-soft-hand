Timing for P1_blem,P1_blem_t{1,2,3,4} and P1_opcode, P1_opcode_t{1,2,3,4} contains the time when the grasp ends, when the lifting begins vs when the object starts to drop. Usually simulations are stopped after the object has dropped
For P2_blem* it contains the time when the grasp ends, when the lifting begins, when the lifting ends, and when the object starts to drop. P2_blem_t1 uses easing while lifting, which is smoother and a necessity for the P2 grasps, which are more fragile and thus can drop the object while lifting.
